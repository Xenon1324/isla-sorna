As a warning, just because something isn't listed here doesn't mean that it's allowed and this list may be updated accordingly. Use your best judgement when conducting yourself.\n\nWe ask that there be no griefing (harassing players so much that they quit).  EXCESSIVE VERBAL ABUSE IS CONSIDERED GRIEFING.\n\nHacking or cheating of any kind is not tolerated. You will face immediate ban without appeal if you are found to be hacking. Evidence of hacking must be provided when reporting a hacker (videos are best for this).\n\nPvP can get heated sometimes, but personal, directed harassment is not tolerated. This includes but is not limited to: posting personal information, posting account information, racism or hate mongering, heavy/explicit sexual language, death threats, etc. If you are the victim of any of the above, please report the individuals responsible including screenshots\n\nImpersonating a Admin, which should be obvious, is not allowed.\n\nInappropriate or offensive names are not allowed. Ie. names containing vulgar, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise offensive, including any usernames which are sexual in nature.\n\nAny and all situations where you can build inside or under the terrain are not allowed.\n\nBox Quetzals as they are affectionally known in the community are not allowed. You are not allowed to use unintended building mechanics to box your quetzal (or other platform creatures) in to protect it from taking damage. Unintended building mechanics include floating structures of any kind.\n\nNo blocking artifacts. It will be seen as an attempt to ruin the game for other players and any number of consequences can befall tribes that do so, up to and including bans.\n\n\nIf you are warned for any of the reasons above and fail to comply, you can be temporarily or permanently banned from the server.",
